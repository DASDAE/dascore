    Apply a shift to the patch data to undo correlation in frequency domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch
        The input patch
    dim
        The dimension name that was correlated in the freq. domain.
    undo_weighting
        If True, also undo the weighting artifact caused by DASCore's dft
        weighting. This is done by simply dividing by the coordinate step.
        See [dft note](`docs/notes/dft_notes.qmd`) for more details.

    **kwargs,
) -> PatchType:
    """
    Correlate source row/columns in a 2D patch with all other row/columns.

    Correlations are done in the frequency domain. This function can accept a
    patch whose target dimension has already been transformed with the
    [`Patch.dft`](`dascore.transform.fourier.dft`) method, otherwise the dft
    will be performed. If the input has already been transformed,
    [`Patch.correlation_shift`](`dascore.proc.correlate.correlate_shift`)
    is useful to undo dft artefacts after the idft is applied.

    While a 2D patch is required for input, a 3D patch is returned where the
    3rd dimesion cooresponds to the source rows/columns. For the case of a
    single source, the [`Patch.squeeze`](`dascore.Patch.squeeze`) method
    can be helpful to remove length 1 dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch : PatchType
        The input data patch to be cross-correlated. Must be 2-dimensional.
        The patch can be in time or frequency domains.
    samples : bool, optional (default = False)
        If True, the argument specified in kwargs refers to the *sample* not
        value along that axis. See examples for details.
    lag
        Deprecated, just use select on the output patch instead.
    **kwargs
        Specifies correlation dimension and the master source(s), to which
        we want to cross-correlate all other channels/time samples.If the
        master source is an array, the function will compute correlations for
        all the posible pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import dascore as dc
    >>> from dascore.units import m, s

    >>> # Get a patch composed of sin waves whose correlation results
    >>> # can easily be checked.
    >>> patch = dc.get_example_patch(
    ...     "sin_wav",
    ...     sample_rate=100,
    ...     frequency=range(10, 20),
    ...     duration=5,
    ...     channel_count=10,
    ... ).taper(time=0.5).set_units(distance='m')
    >>>
    >>> # Example 1
    >>> # Calculate cc for all channels as receivers and
    >>> # the 10 m channel as the master channel. Squeeze the output
    >>> # so the returned patch is 2D.
    >>> cc_patch = patch.correlate(distance = 10 * m).squeeze()
    >>>
    >>> # Example 2
    >>> # Get cc within (-2,2) sec of lag for all channels as receivers
    >>> # and the 10 m channel as the master channel. The new patch has dimensions
    >>> # (lag_time, distance, source_distance)
    >>> cc_patch = (
    ...     patch.correlate(distance = 10 * m)
    ...     .select(lag_time=(-2, 2))
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Example 3
    >>> # First remove every other distance channel (less memory usage)
    >>> # the use the new 2nd channel as the source.

    ...     patch.decimate(distance=2, filter_type=None)
    ...     .correlate(distance=1, samples=True)
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Example 4
    >>> # Correlate along time dimension (perhaps for template matching
    >>> # applications)
    >>> cc_patch = patch.correlate(time=100, samples=True)
    >>>
    >>> # Example 5
    >>> # A pipeline of frequency domain correlation and an array of sources
    >>> padded_patch = patch.pad(time="correlate")  # pad to at least 2n + 1
    >>> dft_patch = patch.dft("time", real=True)

    Notes
    -----
    1 - The cross-correlation is performed in the frequency domain.

    2 - The output dimension is opposite of the one specified in kwargs and
      shares a name with the original coord except the string "lag_" is
      prepended. For example, "lag_time".
