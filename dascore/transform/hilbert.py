    """
    Perform a Hilbert transform on a patch.

    The Hilbert transform returns the analytic signal (complex-valued)
    where the real part is the original signal and the imaginary part
    is the Hilbert transform of the signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch
        The patch to transform.
    dim
        The dimension along which to apply the Hilbert transform.

    Returns
    -------
    PatchType
        A patch with a complex data array representing the analytic signal..

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch
        The patch to process.
    dim
        The dimension along which to calculate the envelope.

    Returns
    -------
    PatchType

    """
    Apply phase weighted stacking to enhance coherent signals.

    Phase weighted stacking uses the instantaneous phase coherence
    to weight the stacking process, enhancing coherent signals while
    suppressing incoherent noise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch
        The patch to stack.
    stack_dim
        The dimension over which the data should be stacked. For typical
        use cases this will be "distance".
    transform_dim
        The dimension along which to perform the Hilbert transform.
        For typical use cases this will be "time". If not provided, it will
        be inferred as the other dimension besides stack dim. If the patch
        has more than 2 dimensions and transform_dim is None, a ParameterError
        is raised.
    power
        The power to which the phase coherence is raised. Higher values
        give more weight to coherent signals.
    {dim_reduce}

    Returns
    -------
    PatchType
        A patch with the phase-weighted stack along the specified dimension.
        The specified dimension will have length 1.

    Notes
    -----
    Phase weighted stacking is described in @schimmel1997noise.

    --------
