The [DASCore Github page](www.github.com/dasdae/dascore) is the place where DASCore
development, support and discussion takes place. If you encounter and issue, discover
a bug, or want to ask a question please first search the issues to see if your issue
has already been addressed. If not, file a new issue by clicking on the green
“New Issue” button and selecting the appropriate issue category.

If you want to discuss new features or propose changes to DASCore then the
[discussion tab](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore/discussions) is the right
place to start.
