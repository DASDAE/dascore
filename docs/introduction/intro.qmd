# Highlights

DasCore is python library for working with distributed fiber optic data. It provides:

1. IO support for common fiber-optic data formats
2. Common processing routines
3. Basic visualizations


# Usage

## Read a single file

```python
import dascore as dc
from dascore.utils.downloader import fetch

# get a path to an example file, replace with your path
file_path = fetch('terra15_das_1_trimmed.hdf5')

spool = dc.spool(file_path)
```

## Read data from a directory of fiber files

```python
import dascore as dc
from dascore.utils.downloader import fetch

# get a path to a directory of das files, replace with your path
directory_path = fetch('terra15_das_1_trimmed.hdf5').parent

spool = dc.spool(directory_path).update()
```

## Get patches (2D array)
```python
import dascore as dc
spool = dc.get_example_spool('diverse_das')

# get patches through iteration
for patch in spool:
    ...

# Or through indexing
patch = spool[0]
```

## Perform processing
```python
import dascore as dc
patch = dc.get_example_spool('random')

out = (
    patch.decimate(time=8)  # decimate along time axis
    .detrend(dim='distance')  # detrend in distance axis
    .pass_filter(time=(None, 10))  # apply bandpass filter
)
```


## Visualize
```python
import dascore as dc
patch = dc.get_example_spool('random')

patch.viz.waterfall(show=True, scale=0.02)
```

# Installation

Simply use pip or conda to install dascore:

```bash
pip install dascore
```
