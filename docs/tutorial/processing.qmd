The following shows some simple examples of patch processing. See the
[proc module documentation](`dascore.proc`) for a list of processing functions.

# Decimate

The [decimate patch function](`dascore.Patch.decimate`) decimates a `Patch`
along a given axis while by default performing low-pass filtering to avoid
[aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing).

## Data creation

First, we create a patch composed of two sine waves; one above the new
decimation frequency and one below.

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.examples.sin_wave_patch(
    sample_rate=1000,
    frequency=[200, 10],
    channel_count=2,
)
_ = patch.viz.wiggle(show=True)
```

## IIR filter

Next we decimate by 10x using IIR filter

```{python}
decimated_iir = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type='iir')
_ = decimated_iir.viz.wiggle(show=True)
```

Notice the lowpass filter removed the 200 Hz signal and only
the 10Hz wave remains.

## FIR filter

Next we decimate by 10x using FIR filter.

```{python}
decimated_fir = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type='fir')
_ = decimated_fir.viz.wiggle(show=True)
```

## No Filter

Next, we decimate without a filter to purposely induce aliasing.

```{python}
decimated_no_filt = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type=None)
_ = decimated_no_filt.viz.wiggle(show=True)
```
