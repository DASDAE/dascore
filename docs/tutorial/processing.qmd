The following shows some simple examples of patch processing. See the
[proc module](`dascore.proc`) for a list of all processing functions.

# Basic

There are several "basic" processing functions which manipulate the patch metadata, shape, etc. Many of these are covered in the [patch tutorial](patch.qmd), but here are a few that aren't:

## Transpose
The [`transpose` patch function](`dascore.Patch.transpose`) patch function simply transposes the dimensions of the patch, either by rotating the dimensions or to a new specified dimension.

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()
print(f"dims before transpose: {patch.dims}")

transposed = patch.transpose()
print(f"dims after transpose: {transposed.dims}")

# Dimension order can be manually specified as well.
transposed = patch.transpose("time", "distance")
```

## Squeeze
[`squeeze`](`dascore.Patch.squeeze`) removes dimensions which have a single value (see also `numpy.squeeze`).

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()
# Select first distance value to make distance dim flat.

flat_patch = patch.select(distance=0, samples=True)
print(f"Pre-squeeze dims: {flat_patch.shape}")

squeezed = flat_patch.squeeze()
print(f"Post-squeeze dims: {squeezed.shape}")
```

## Dropna

The [`dropna` patch function](`dascore.Patch.dropna`) patch function drops "nullish" values from a given label.

```{python}
import numpy as np

import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()

# Create a patch with nan values
data = np.array(patch.data)
data[:, 0] = np.NaN
patch_with_nan = patch.new(data=data)

# Drop Nan along axis 1
dim = patch_with_nan.dims[1]
no_na_patch = patch_with_nan.dropna(dim)

assert not np.any(np.isnan(no_na_patch.data))
```


# Decimate

[decimate](`dascore.Patch.decimate`) decimates a `Patch` along a given axis while by default performing low-pass filtering to avoid [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing).

## Data creation

First, we create a patch composed of two sine waves; one above the new
decimation frequency and one below.

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.examples.get_example_patch(
    "sin_wav",
    sample_rate=1000,
    frequency=[200, 10],
    channel_count=2,
)
patch.viz.wiggle(show=True);
```

## IIR filter

Next we decimate by 10x using IIR filter

```{python}
decimated_iir = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type='iir')
decimated_iir.viz.wiggle(show=True);
```

Notice the lowpass filter removed the 200 Hz signal and only
the 10Hz wave remains.

## FIR filter

Next we decimate by 10x using FIR filter.

```{python}
decimated_fir = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type='fir')
decimated_fir.viz.wiggle(show=True);
```

## No Filter

Next, we decimate without a filter to purposely induce aliasing.

```{python}
decimated_no_filt = patch.decimate(time=10, filter_type=None)
decimated_no_filt.viz.wiggle(show=True);
```

# Taper

[taper](`dascore.Patch.taper`) is used to taper the edges of a patch dimension to zero. To see this, let's create a patch of all 1s and apply the taper function

```{python}
import numpy as np
import dascore as dc

_patch = dc.get_example_patch()
patch_ones = _patch.new(data=np.ones_like(_patch.data))
```

The following code will apply a 10% taper, meaning a cosine taper is applied along the first and last 10% of the specified dimension.

```{python}
patch_ones.taper(time=0.1).viz.waterfall();
```

Passing a tuple of values enables different amounts of tapering for each end of the dimension.


```{python}
# Apply a 10% taper to the start and 30% to the end of distance dimension.
patch_ones.taper(distance=(0.1, 0.3)).viz.waterfall();
```

Either element of the tuple can be `None` which indicates no tapering is applied.

```{python}
# Only apply 10% taper to the end of the distance dimension.
patch_ones.taper(distance=(None, 0.1)).viz.waterfall();
```

See also the [edge effects recipe](../recipes/edge_effects.qmd) for using tapering to help filtering.

# Rolling
The [rolling patch function](`dascore.Patch.rolling`) implements moving window operators similar to [pandas rolling](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html). It is useful for smoothing, calculating aggregated statistics, etc.

Here is an example of using a rolling mean to smooth along the time axis:

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch("example_event_1")
# Apply moving mean window over every 10 samples
dt = patch.get_coord('time').step

smoothed = patch.rolling(time=50*dt).mean()
smoothed.viz.waterfall(scale=.1);
```

Notice the NaN values at the start of the time axis. These can be trimmed with [`Patch`.dropna](`dascore.Patch.dropna`).
