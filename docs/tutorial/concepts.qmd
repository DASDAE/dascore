This page highlights a few core DASCore concepts.

# Time

Any expression of time should use [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html) time
constructs, which include [datetime64](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.datetime64)
and [timedelta64](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.timedelta64).

For example:

```{python}
import numpy as np

# create a datetime64 with a very precise time string
time_1 = np.datetime64('2022-01-01T15:12:11.172455')

# create a new time by adding some time to time_1
time_2 = time_1 + np.timedelta64(60, 's')

# get the number of hour separating them:
delta_1 = (time_2 - time_1) / np.timedelta64(1, 'h')
```

DASCore provides two convenience functions for working with times:

[to_datetime64](`dascore.utils.time.to_datetime64`) which tries to convert most types of inputs expressing date times
to the proper numpy type. [to_timedelta64](`dascore.utils.time.to_datetime64`) performs a similar function for
timedeltas. For example:

```{python}
import dascore as dc

# convert a time string to a datetime64 object.
time_1 = dc.to_datetime64('2022-01-01T12:12:12.1212')

# convert a timestamp (seconds from 1970-01-01) to a datetime object
time_2 = dc.to_datetime64(610243200)
```

In general you should try to be as explicit as possible and use numpy's time constructs directly, but the
dascore time functions provide a helpful way to sanitize a variety of time inputs.

# Dimension Selection

Most of DASCore's processing methods can be applied along any dimension. For example,
[pass_filter](`dascore.proc.filter.pass_filter`) can be applied along any dimension by passing a range and
dimension name:

```{python}
import dascore as dc
patch = dc.get_example_patch()

filtered_time = patch.pass_filter(time=(1, 5))
filtered_distance = patch.pass_filter(distance=(0.1, 0.2))
```
However, the meaning of the values (ie frequency vs period) depends on the function, so be sure to read the docs!

# Data structures

DASCore has two key data structures; the [Patch](patch.qmd) and the [Spool](spool.qmd).
Both of these have their own tutorial pages.

The `Patch` contains a contiguous block of N dimensional data and metadata.
The `Spool` manages a group of `Patch`s. These can be in memory, on
disk, or a remote resource.
