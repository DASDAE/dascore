Here, we elaborate on how you can build new documentation or make changes to existing dASCore documentation.

## Building/Editing documentation

First, install the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

To ensure Quarto is installed properly and to get the installation directory:

Run "where quarto" command for the Windows

```bash
where quarto
```

Or, run "which quarto" command for Linux/Mac

```bash
which quarto
```

If you have not already installed jupyter in your environment, install it using conda:

```bash
conda install jupyter
```

Go to the DASCore directory on your machine:

```bash
cd dascore
```

Then:

```bash
python scripts/build_api_docs.py
```

```bash
quarto preview docs
```

Now, you can make new documentation or make changes in the /dascore/index.qmd file, /dascore/docs/ directory and so on.
