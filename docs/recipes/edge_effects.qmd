[`taper`](`dascore.proc.taper.taper`) is often used to manage "edge effects" associated with several other types of processing such as filtering. For example:

### Bandpass filtering without tapering

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = (
    dc.get_example_patch('example_event_1')
    .pass_filter(time=(None, 300))
)

patch.viz.waterfall(show=True, scale=0.04);
```

### Bandpass filtering with tapering

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = (
    dc.get_example_patch('example_event_1')
    .taper(time=0.05)
    .pass_filter(time=(None, 300))
)

patch.viz.waterfall(show=True, scale=0.15);
```
