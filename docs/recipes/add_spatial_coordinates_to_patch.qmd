title: Add spatial coordinates to patch

Rather than plotting distance or depth, sometimes it is desirable to plot channel number (an index of the non-time dimension).

To do this involves three steps:

1. Adding a new coordinate called channel number
2. Setting the channel number as the dimension
3. Call plot function


```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import dascore as dc
from dascore.utils.downloader import fetch


# get path for example coordinates
path = fetch("brady_hs_DAS_DTS_coords.csv")

# read coordinates data from csv file
coord_table = pd.read_csv(path)

# Make patch from example
patch = dc.get_example_patch()

# get length of distance axis
dist_len = patch.coord_shapes["distance"][0]


```


```{python}
# add coordinates to patch

# plot coordinates


```
