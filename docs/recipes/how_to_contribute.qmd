On this page, we provide a step-by-step procedure on how you can start contributing to the DASCore package.

# Starting point: Installing DASCore in development mode

For the first time using DASCore in development mode, or if a new release is out, you need to install DASCore as it is mentioned [here](https://dascore.org/contributing/dev_install.html).
Otherwise, you just need to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate dascore
```

Then, while you have cloned it at the first step or in the past, run a test:

```bash
cd dascore
```

```bash
pytest
```


# Start working on a new branch and push it to the DASCore GitHub repo

To create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

```bash
cd dascore
```

Now, you can make changes to the codes. To test what you have done:

```bash
pytest
```

Also, to be able to interact and debug after testing:

```bash
pytest --pdb
```

Finally, to make a commit and push your branch to GitHub, follow below steps:

1- Run the following command twice:

```bash
pre-commit run â€“all
```

2- Run all the following commands:

```bash
git add --all
```

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git config --global user.email user's_email
```

```bash
git config --global user.name username
```

```bash
git commit -m your_comment
```

```bash
git push origin branch_name
```
