On this page, we provide a step-by-step procedure on how you can start contributing to the DASCore package.

# Step 1: Install DASCore in development mode

For the first time using DASCore in development mode, or if a new release is out, you need to install DASCore as it is mentioned [here](https://dascore.org/contributing/dev_install.html).
Otherwise, you just need to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate dascore
```

First, pull the latest changes and tags, and then run a test in the dascore repository (where you cloned it before):

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master --tags
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```bash
cd dascore
pytest
```


# Step 2: Create a new branch to work on

To create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b "branch name"
```

Now, you can make changes to the codes. To test what you have done, while you are in the dascore repository:

```bash
pytest
```

Or, to be able to interact and debug after testing:

```bash
pytest --pdb
```

Finally, to make a commit and push your branch to GitHub, follow below steps:

1- Run the following command twice(the first time will automatically fix some issues):

```bash
pre-commit run â€“all
```

2- Run all the following commands:

```bash
git add --all
```

```bash
git commit -m "your commit"
```

```bash
git push origin branch_name
```
