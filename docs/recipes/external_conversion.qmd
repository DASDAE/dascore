Although DASCore has quite a bit of functionality, it is not intended to do everything you might possibly want, and sometimes other libraries are better suited for a particular task. In addition to making it simple to access the underlying data as shown in the [patch tutorial](../tutorial/patch.qmd), DASCore provides convenience functions to convert data to formats used by other libraries. Here are a few examples:


## Pandas

```python
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()

# convert to a dataframe
df = patch.io.to_dataframe()

# convert a dataframe to a patch
patch_from_df = dc.io.dataframe_to_patch(df)
```

## Xarray

```python
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()

# convert to xarray's DataArray
dar = patch.io.to_xarray()

# convert a DataArray to a patch
patch_from_dar = dc.io.xarray_to_patch(dar)
```

## ObsPy

```python
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch()

# convert the patch to an ObsPy Stream
stream = patch.io.to_obspy()

# convert an ObsPy Stream to a patch
patch_from_dar = dc.io.obspy_to_patch(stream)
```

:::{callout-note}
As explained in the [`obspy_to_patch` docs](`dascore.utils.io.obspy_to_patch`), there must be a value in the stats dict which indicates values for a non-time dimension. For example, each trace might have a 'distance' key in its stats dict which DASCore uses to build the Patch.
