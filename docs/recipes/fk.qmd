[F-k transforms](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/F-k_filtering) are common in geophysical applications for various types of filtering.

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = (
    dc.get_example_patch('example_event_1')
    .set_units("mm/(m*s)", distance='m', time='s')
    .taper(time=0.05)
    .pass_filter(time=(None, 300))
)

patch.viz.waterfall(show=True, scale=0.2);
```

We can transform and visualize the patch in the F-K domain using the dft.

```{python}
# Apply transform on all dimensions
fk_patch = patch.dft(patch.dims)

# We can't plot complex arrays so only plot amplitude
ax = fk_patch.abs().viz.waterfall()

# Zoom in around interesting frequencies
ax.set_xlim(-500, 500);
ax.set_ylim(-.2, .2);
```
