title: Using DASCore with Docker
execute:

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you may also run the stable build of DASCore in a Docker container.

First you need to clone the DASCore main repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore
```

Then go to the DASCore directory and run docker build:
```bash
cd dascore
docker build -t dascore .
```

To run a Python script with DASCore, mount the directory containing your scripts to the `/app` directory in the image using the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/app dascore python /app/test.py
```

In the example above, we assume `test.py` is in our parent working directory (`$PWD`).
