title: "Velocity to Strain Rate"

This recipe shows several different options for converting velocity type patches to strain_rate. This type of transformation is needed for Terra15 data recorded in "velocity" mode.

:::{.callout-note}
Although DASCore usually refers to these type of data as "velocity", since the units are m/s, the recordings represent a cumulative velocity, or deformation rate, along the cable and not an equivalent velocity that might be recorded by a point sensor aligned with the cable.

## DASCore Converters

There are two functions for converting velocity data to strain rate:

1. [Patch.velocity_to_strain_rate](`dascore.Patch.velocity_to_strain_rate`)
2. [Patch.velocity_to_strain_rate_edgeless](`dascore.Patch.velocity_to_strain_rate_edgeless`)

The first function uses a central difference scheme when possible, but also a forward/backwards difference scheme on the edges. This results in patch that is the same shape as the input patch, but, depending on the parameters, there may be some instability on the end channels. It only supports even `step_multiple` values which means the smallest gauge length is twice the distance step. It also supports higher order filters if the [findiff library](https://findiff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is installed.

The second function does not support higher order filters, and removes edges of the patch where the full finite difference is not possible. It does, however, support odd values of `step_multiple`, in which case the strain is estimated between existing points on a staggered grid.

When step_multiple is even, the two functions produce identical results after accounting for their different handling of edges.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np

import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch("deformation_rate_event_1")

for mult in [2, 4, 6, 8]:
 # Get function 1 output and trim off edges.
  strain1 = (
      patch
      .velocity_to_strain_rate(step_multiple=mult)
      .select(distance=(mult//2, -mult//2), samples=True)
  )
  
  # Function 2's output should match function 1. 
  strain2 = patch.velocity_to_strain_rate_edgeless(step_multiple=mult)
  
  assert np.allclose(strain1.data, strain2.data)
```

## Effect of Gauge Length
For a lower order filter, the gauge length can be thought of as the average length over which the strain is estimated and is controlled by the `step_multiple` parameter. A larger gauge length can improve signal-to-noise ratio, but the resulting outputs get "smeared" across more spatial channels. Here are a few examples to illustrate the concept.

First, the smallest possible gauge length which occurs when `step_multiple=1`, in other words, the gauge length is equal to the distance step. For example, @fig-different-gauge-length shows converting from velocity to strain rate for an event recorded by a Terra15 interrogator. 

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: "Gauge length effects on event."
#| label: fig-different-gauge-length
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch("deformation_rate_event_1")

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8.4, 6.5))

for sm, ax in zip([1, 2, 6, 12], axes.flatten()):
    # Convert to microstrain
    strain = (
        (patch.velocity_to_strain_rate_edgeless(step_multiple=sm) * 1e6)
        .update_attrs(data_units=None)
    )
    strain.viz.waterfall(ax=ax, scale=(-30, 30), scale_type="absolute")
    ax.set_title(f"step multiple: {sm}")

plt.tight_layout()
# plt.show()
```

Notice how the noisy channels around distance 2600m and 3400m get smeared with larger step multiples.

## Higher order filters
Rather than simple finite differences using only two points, higher order filters are possible. @yang2022filtering discuss the advantages of such an approach. @fig-different-order shows the same event from above with different orders applied.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: "Order effects on event."
#| label: fig-different-order
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch("deformation_rate_event_1")

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8.4, 6.5))

for order, ax in zip([2, 4, 6, 12], axes.flatten()):
    # Convert to microstrain
    strain = (
        (patch.velocity_to_strain_rate(order=order) * 1e6)
        .update_attrs(data_units=None)
    )
    strain.viz.waterfall(ax=ax, scale=(-30, 30), scale_type="absolute")
    ax.set_title(f"order: {order}")

plt.tight_layout()
```

:::{.callout-warning}
Notice in @fig-different-order some filter artefacts along the edge channels are introduced for the higher order filters.
