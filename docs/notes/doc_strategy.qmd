title: DASCore Documentation Strategy
---

DASCore's documentation strives to follows [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach. In this system (developed by Daniele Procida) there are four types of documentation, each with different goals:

The sections of DASCore's documentation can be classified as follows:

**Tutorials**: Tutorial, Contributing

**How-to-Guides**: Recipes

**Explanation**: Notes

**Reference**: API

We should try to not mix these types of documentation, but rather provide links in relevant locations. A few implications:

* Long explanations of theory don't belong in the tutorial section; put a link to a page in the notes section if long explination is needed.

* Tutorial pages should only show basic usage of functions/methods/classes, then [cross reference](../contributing/documentation.qmd#cross-references) the API page.

* Notes shouldn't spend much time teaching how to use the code, they should be theory-focused
