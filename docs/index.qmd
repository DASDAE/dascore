Version-specific documentation builds are attached to the [release pages](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore/releases).

# Highlights

DASCore is a Python library for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). It provides:

1. IO support for [many DAS data formats](supported_formats.qmd)
2. Common processing routines
3. Basic visualizations

:::{.callout-note}
DASCore is part of the [DAS Data Analysis Ecosystem (DASDAE)](https://dasdae.org).

# Introductory usage

## Read a file

```python
import dascore as dc

# file_path is a path to a directory, file, or remote uri. 
file_path = "my/file/here.h5"
spool = dc.spool(file_path)
patch = spool[0]
```

## Working with a directory of DAS files

```python
import dascore as dc

directory_path = "/path/to/data/directory/"

spool = (
    # Create a spool to interact with directory data
    dc.spool(directory_path)
    # Index the directory contents
    .update()
    # Sub-select a specific time range
    .select(time_min=('2020-01-01', ...))
    # Specify chunk of the output patches
    .chunk(time=60, overlap=10)
)
```

## Get patches (array w/ metadata)

```{python}
import dascore as dc

spool = dc.get_example_spool('diverse_das')

# Spools are like lists, you can get patches through iteration
for patch in spool:
    ...

# or through indexing
patch = spool[0]
```

## Perform processing

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch('random_das')

out = (
    # Decimate along time axis (keep every 8th sample)
    patch.decimate(time=8)
    # Detrend along the distance dimension
    .detrend(dim='distance') 
    # Apply 10Hz low-pass filter along time dimension
    .pass_filter(time=(..., 10))
)
```

## Visualize

```{python}
import dascore as dc

patch = dc.get_example_patch('example_event_2')

patch.viz.waterfall(show=True, scale=0.2);
```

# Installation
