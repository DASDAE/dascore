  abstract  = "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a relatively recent
               development in the use of fiber-optic cable for measurement of
               ground motion. Discrete fiber-optic sensors, typically using a
               Bragg diffraction grating, have been in research and development
               and field testing for more than 15 years with geophysical
               applications at least 12 years old (Bostick, 2000, and summary
               in Keul et al., 2005). However, developments in recent years
               have sought to remove the need for point sensors by using the
               fiber cable itself as a sensor (Mestayer et al., 2011; Miller et
               al., 2012).",
