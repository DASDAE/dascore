title: "Publish a new release"

On this page, we provide a step-by-step guidance on how to publish a new release for DASCore.

## Step 1: Draft a new release and publish

On DASCore GitHub page, you should go to [Releases](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore/releases), draft a new release. On the draft, choose a new tag a release title (e.g. 0.0.14). Finally, generate release notes and publish the relase.

## Step 2: Check the release status

On [Actions](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore/actions), check the release status for both "PublishPackage" and "BuildDeployStableDocs". Also, make sure [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dascore/) is updated.

## Step 3: Commit required changes for Conda

For [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/dascore-feedstock), you need to wait a few hours to get a pull request, and then verify/edit the dependencies, extras, etc. on [meta.yaml](https://github.com/conda-forge/dascore-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/meta.yaml) at /dascore-feedstock/recipe directory based on [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/DASDAE/dascore/blob/master/pyproject.toml) at /dascore directory. Therefore, if they do not match, you need to clone the dascore-feedstock branch, modify and push it. After merging the pull request, you can verify the latest DASCore version at [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dascore).
