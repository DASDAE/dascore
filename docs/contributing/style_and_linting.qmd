# Linting

DASCore uses [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code linting.
If you have properly installed DASCore' pre-commit hooks they will be invoked automatically when you make a git commit.
If any complaints are raised simply address them and try again.

As a reminder, you can install pre-commit hooks like so:

```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Then run all the hooks like this:

```shell
pre-commit run --all
```

It is often useful to run the previous command twice before making any changes because many of the hooks
will automatically fix the code.

# Type Hints

DASCore makes extensive use of Python 3's [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
Use them to annotate any public functions/methods. See [the docstring section](documentation.qml#Doc-string)
for more information and some examples.
